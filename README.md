This is a demo Terra DApp to show how a project might be setup and managed by a group of people. Terrain is pretty neat, but other nieve options also exist. (To my knowledge, this is currently the only all-in-one packaging setup for a Terra DApp, with the exception of the 'templates' from the official Terra repo that are ready-to-go directly after downloading.)

See the official Terra docs on Terrain for getting something similar setup, or how to spin up this instance to test development yourself.

The frontend is deployed to github-pages under the 'deployment' tab for your convenience with the keys added to make it easier to test. These keys should never be used outside this repo.
